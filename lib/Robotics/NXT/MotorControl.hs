{-|
A message-based control of a NXT brick via remotely executed @MotorControl@ program. The main goal of this approach is to achieve
better precision of motor movements as program monitors and adapts motor commands on the NXT brick itself. For example, common
motor's overshoot is thus removed in most cases.

You should download\/compile @MotorControl@ program from <http://www.mindstorms.rwth-aachen.de/trac/wiki/MotorControl> and upload
it to the NXT brick with @nxt-upload@ program. This module will then run that program and sends it messages to control the NXT brick.
Because commands will be executed and controlled directly on the NXT brick more powerful and precise control is possible.

Please refer to original documentation of @MotorControl@ program for more information, description of commands and explanations
how to use them. This interface also implements static pauses between commands mentioned there and required by @MotorControl@. This
means functions calls will block for this time so consider using special Haskell thread for communication with the NXT brick.
Dynamic\/minimal pauses are not implemented and have to be taken care of by user of this interface.

Check "Robotics.NXT.Remote" for another (simpler) approach to message-based control. It would be great to one day combine
@MotorControl@'s precision with API (especially interruptability) of @remote.nxc@.

motor position information at the same time).

The same thing can be achieved by using 'resetMotorPosition' with 'InternalPosition' argument.

or is it ready to accept new commands?

Implements static pauses.
